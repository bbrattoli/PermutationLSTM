# Temporal Permutation LSTM
Created by [Biagio Brattoli](https://bbrattoli.github.io/homepage/)

Code used in the CVPR 2017 Paper - "LSTM Self-Supervision for Detailed Behavior Analysis" [link]()

## Introduction

Implementation code for training the Permutation LSTM in tensorflow and caffe. 

## Installation

Follow the instraction for the installation of the preferred framework (tensorflow or caffe) and run the script!

## Usage

The sequences are given in a txt file, one sequence per row and each frame is separated by black space (or tab).

## Acknowledgments

I thank [Artsiom Sanakoyeu](https://github.com/asanakoy/) for the alexnet implementation in tensorflow and [Uta Buechler](https://utabuechler.github.io/homepage/) for updating the network for the LSTM.
